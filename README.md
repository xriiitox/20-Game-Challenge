# xriii's 20 Game Challenge

Following the list of games at https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/, I am challenging myself to make at least 1 game from each section of this list. 

Each game can be found in their individual folders, and later I may combine all of the games I've made into a mega-project of all of them.

I'm too lazy to compile and distribute the games myself, so if you would like to play the games, feel free to clone the repo and open the games in Godot.
